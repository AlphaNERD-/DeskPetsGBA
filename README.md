# DeskPets Controller
This software allows you to control DeskPets products using a Gameboy Advance.

The process is easy:
1. Start your DeskPets device.
2. Just plug the Universal Adapter into the Headphone jack of your Gameboy Advance.
3. Select the model and the color of your DeskPets device.
4. Press START and have fun.

## What are DeskPets?
DeskPets are small robots created by the DeskPets company. Or they used to create them since there are no new models built anymore since 2014. There are a few models, some of which only allowing you to steer them and others being able to interact with their surroundings and other models.

Here are some videos demonstrating the individual models:

## Since the company seems to be dead and their products barely known, why even bother making this?
I like their products, but their remote control app is clunky and not even available on the Play Store anymore. Probably not on the App Store either. Their remote app feels clunky because the app does not allow to flip the screen in order to move the Universal Adapter out of the way. And less phones come out with an integrated headphone jack than back in 2014. While dongles are usually included with the phones, the Universal Adapter will dangle on the adapter. The adapter won't fire the infrared signals in the right direction and therefore the remote control setup won't work. There are also other little issues with the app like having to manually stop certain DeskPets models. And finally, the controls won't feel as good as the physical buttons on a Gameboy.

That's why i decided to create my own DeskPets control software for the Gameboy Advance.

## Supported models
 - Tankbot
 - Battletank

## TODO  
 - 2 control types:  
   - Car controls to support Carbot and Driftbot
   - DPAD-only Controls to Skitterbot and Trekbot  
 - Saving and loading the configuration  
 - Reduce CPU load in Main Menu  
 - Add nicer GUI later(?)
